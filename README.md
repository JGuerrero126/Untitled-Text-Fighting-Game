# Warriors Of Wrath

Warriors Of Wrath is a text-based fighting game that allows you to fight against a computer controlled opponent in single player or to fight against someone else at your computer in two player.

## Moves

While in a battle, you are able to choose from 4 different moves to do. Let's break those down!

### Guard

Guarding allows your Warrior to brace themselves for an opponents Attack, lowering the damage taken in most instances and even eliminating all damage taken if your Warrior's defense is high enough.

### Total Guard AKA Perfect Guard

Once per battle, you may have your Warrior engage in a Total Guard. Doing this will have your Warrior defend themselves with everything they have, allowing them to completely guard against any Attack your opponent may throw at them. If you attempt to Total Guard a second time, your Warrior will attempt to guard but be too tired to do it successfully and be helpless to whatever your opponent has chosen to do that turn.

### Basic Attack

A Basic Attack allows your Warrior to use a Attack with lower damage.

### Heavy Attack

A Heavy Attack lets your Warrior use an Attack with much higher damage.
